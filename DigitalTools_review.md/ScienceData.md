# Sciencedata.dk
_Petra's reserach diary and notes_

Upon being not satisfied with DeicData.dk, I have tried testing the ScienceData.dk in hope we could use this service for our research.
Here is the summary of my first observations.

I have focused my scoping to the usability of the sciencedata.dk from the perspective of a user-researcher collaborating with local and external people, sharing large datasets, and with the least time spent on sys-admin as possible. I have focused on doing the simple regression test with the following questions: 

```sh
Can I do X? YES - NO. 
If I can do X, does the long-term benefit of X exceeds the effort needed to do it? YES - NO. 
Does X meet my expectations? YES - NO.
Is there a way to automate X to lower the friction? YES - NO.
```

I have tested the following categories (X):

**1. Data storage**
a. Uploading large datasets (>100 GB)
b. Storing large datasets
c. Sharing large datasets within the team
d. Sharing large datasets with external collaborators (AU, Europe, world)
e. Ease of use and data manipulation (moving, renaming, setting sharing permissions to different groups)
f. Export and available formats
g. Back-up solution
**2. Good practice or FAIR principles**
a. Open science principles
b. Version control
c. Metadata preservation
d. Assigning new metadata/labels
e. Association with research publishing platforms
f. Where does the data live - do I have a control
**3. Team collaboration**
a. Collaborative writing
b. Code sharing
**4. Team management**
a. Shared calendar
b. Distribution list (one email going to all)
c. Progress monitoring



## Positives
- login into the web browser via institution is easy and works almost all the time 
- 170 GB of online space that could be in theory used for sharing data, or my backup
- tags and metadata seems to be quite useful, you can assign them to documents and create a new ones
- photos - you can display them directly on the screen
- groups - you can create your own groups


## Negatives
- collaborative writing - limited, it enables only .txt and I am not sure if people can edit the document at the same time
- versioning - you can see versions of your own documents that you have created, and either download that version or resrore back to it if you are sure
- creating a document - via upload, or only in Home directory via the New dropdown, enables to create Text file or folder or import from link.
- moving files - work only in your home directory, you can't move files even in the shared folder you own
- sharing with others - very difficult, I can share with individuals or with the group I have created, but the file does not display in the shared group I have created (dataplex in my case). It stays in the original folder and it now shows in the Shared by me folder, which you can't further organise, so I assume it would be a giant mess in a while
- sharing with me - I can see what others have shared with me, but have limited rights to it, for example I don't see the version history and can't do anything about it
- creating shared groups - tricky, first people have to log in, then you invite them,  and then they accept the invitation, it may take few hours for the invitation to arrive, not intuitive
- seeing what is shared with me - I have limited rights to the documents that are shared with me, I see them only via Shared with me folder, not via the Group folder that is in fact only accesible to the Owner
- import - has to be setup properly, need to read the documentation but I hope there could be some automatization; you can import only into home not into shared groups
- upload - tried to upload several GB, failed, manual, you can upload only text files, PDFs, no images; can't do anything else while uploading, so in the case of large files it can take hour or more

## Petra's opinion:
Sciencedata.dk can be used for storing and sharing large files such as satellite images, granted we manage to upload them, but I do not recommend it for day-to-day activities of the team. The Sciencedata.dk is especially not suitable for collaborative writing, small data sharing within a closed group, version control of documents. 

I recommend to purchase a Google Suite, where all the initial hurdles are already solved to save several weeks, maybe months of tweaking the Sciencedata.dk as there is no apparent support at the Aarhus University and we would be doing it all ourselves.
